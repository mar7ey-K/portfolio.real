        <p style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1955, a woman of the name Dorcas Reilly worked as a supervisor in the home economics division at <b>Campbell's Headquarters</b> in Camden, New Jersey. There, she was asked to create a dish that would be featured in the <i><u>Associated Press</u></i>. The recipe was based on ingredients you had around the house, and this would include the Campbell mushroom soup and green beans. Dorcas, and her team, toyed with many ingredients, including celery or ham, but ended up on the Green Bean Casserole we know today, it was cheap, took little time to make, and helped with the more and more women joining the work-force because there was no one else at home to create such complex meals. Dorcas originally called this dish the <strong>Green Bean Bake</strong>, and was surprised how much of a hit it was! This recipe is printed onto the Campbell's mushroom soup can and is made during Thanksgiving by millions of Americans.</p>
